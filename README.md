#Hi,

My name is Jesus Castaneda. I have been learning coding for the past 3 years. While my focus has always been web development,  I recently been moving towards cybersecuirty. At the moment, I'm working on getting my COMPTIA certification for Network, Security, and Linux by the end of this year.
